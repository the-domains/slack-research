  Beneath the current economic crisis lies another crisis of far greater
  proportions: the depreciation in companies of community-people's sense of
  belonging to and caring for something larger than themselves. Decades of
  short-term management, in the United States especially, have inflated the
  importance of CEOs and reduced others in the corporation to fungible
  commodities-human resources to be "downsized" at the drop of a share price.
