            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Productive teams everywhere are using this bot... (including Slack) - letters from slash-hyphen</h1><p>A bot that creates visibility into an organization's KPIs is transformative. The team at Slack has developed a bot based approach that changes the way their employees look at the business.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Is group chat making you sweat? - Signal v. Noise</h1><p>Group chat is like being in an all-day meeting with random participants and no agenda. In 2006 we launched Campfire, the first modern SAAS group chat and messaging tool for business. Since then, quite a few business chat and messaging tools like Hipchat, Flowdock, Slack and others have sprung up.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/ef237207f749c4e3c092c9cf38519e643e2bb18f.png"></article>]]></description>

This won't be easy, but it's for the best. As you and I both know, things started out so wonderfully .

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Rebuilding Companies as Communities</h1><p>Beneath the current economic crisis lies another crisis of far greater proportions: the depreciation in companies of community-people's sense of belonging to and caring for something larger than themselves. Decades of short-term management, in the United States especially, have inflated the importance of CEOs and reduced others in the corporation to fungible commodities-human resources to be "downsized" at the drop of a share price.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/3288aab44ee2ead90f656204a3aedc42b724599f.png"></article>]]></description>

So did many of the engineers she spent 10 years working with at Google, in the California headquarters of one of the world's most valuable technology companies. When she was eventually invited to a poker night with other engineers, the group of white, male colleagues fell silent as she walked into the room.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/138fab22b41d6747f301a7bc94174cd4e9237fd4.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>What Slack is doing to our offices-and our minds</h1><p>Walking into the Slack offices in downtown San Francisco feels like walking into a Slack channel online. Brightly colored sofas in the shape of hashtags fill the shared spaces, surrounded by a comfortable margin of airy whitespace. As company rep Katie Wattie leads me around, I realize that every conference room is named after an emoji.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/fdacf140d371c6460ee0759163dc2cc8c96db8a1.jpg"></article>]]></description>
